For the head:

Use yellow yarn

Row 1: 6 single crochets in a magic ring

Row 2: 6 increasing stitches/an increasing stitch in each stitch (12 stitches total after this row)

Row 3: (1 single crochet, 1 increasing stitch) x 6 (18 stitches total)

Row 4: (2 single crochets, 1 increasing stitch) x 6 (24 stitches total)

Row 5: (3 single crochets, 1 increasing stitch) x 6 (30 stitches total)

Row 6: (4 single crochets, 1 increasing stitch) x 6 (36 stitches)

Rows 7 - 10: 36 single crochets per row

Row 11: (5 single crochets, 1 increasing stitch) x 6 (42 stitches)

Row 12: 42 single crochets

Row 13: (12 single crochets, 1 decreasing stitch) x 3 (39 stitches)

Row 14: (11 single crochets, 1 decreasing stitch) x 3 (36 stitches)

Row 16: (9 single crochets, 1 decreasing stitch) x 3 (30 stitches)

Row 17: (2 single crochets, 1 decreasing stitch) x 6 (24 stitches)

Don't cut off the yarn; the head will continue into the body

Attach the eyes, sew on the cheek circles and ears, and stitch the mouth and nose

...

For the cheek circles:

Use red yarn

Row 1: 6 single crochets in a magic ring

Row 2: 6 increasing stitches/an increasing stitch in each stitch (12 stitches total)

Row 3: A single crochet in each of the first two stitches

I sewed on the cheek circles around row 12 of the head, since that's where the "cheeks" were (since the head got wider at that point due to the increasing stitches), and I attached the eyes around row 10 of the head (right above the top of the cheek circles)

...

For the ears:

Start with black yarn

Row 1: 4 single crochets in a magic ring

Row 2: (1 single crochet, 1 double crochet) x 2 (6 stitches)

Row 3: (2 single crochets, 1 double crochet) x 2 (8 stitches)

Row 4: (3 single crochets, 1 double crochet) x 2 (10 stitches)

Row 5: (4 single crochets, 1 double crochet) x 2 (12 stitches)

Row 6: 12 single crochets

Switch to yellow yarn

Rows 7 - 15: 12 single crochets per row

Take the last stitch off the hook, cut the yarn, and pull the yarn through to create a slip knot

Repeat these steps to create the other ear

...

For the arms:

Row 1: 6 single crochets in a magic ring

Row 2: 6 increasing stitches/an increasing stitch in each stitch (12 stitches total)

Rows 3 - 11: 108 single crochets (12 single crochets per row)

Take the last stitch off the hook, cut the yarn, and pull the yarn through to create a slip knot

Add stuffing

Repeat these steps to create the other arm

...

For the feet:

Row 1: 6 single stitches in a magic ring

Row 2: 6 increasing stitches/an increasing stitch in each stitch (12 stitches total)

Row 3: (3 single crochets, 3 increasing stitches) x 2 (18 stitches)

Row 4: (6 single crochets, 3 increasing stitches) x 2 (24 stitches)

Row 5: 54 single crochets (just over two rows of single crochets) (the reason why this number is so weird is because I thought I was working with 18 stitches per row when in reality I was working with 24 stitches per row, but the outcome was still okay so I just did the same thing with the other foot for symmetry)

ALTERNATIVE: Rows 5 - 6: 24 single crochets per row

Row 6: (6 single crochets, 3 decreasing stitches) x 2 (18 stitches)

Row 7: (3 single crochets, 3 decreasing stitches) x 2 (12 stitches)

Row 8: 3 decreasing stitches (6 stitches)

**Stuffing can be added after either row 6 or row 7

Take the last stitch off the hook, cut the yarn, and pull the yarn through to create a slip knot

...

For the tail:

Row 1: 18 chain stitches, plus 1 chain stitch (19)

Row 2: Skip the first stitch, single crochet in each of the next stitches, 1 chain stitch

Rows 3 - 7: Repeat what was done for Row 2 once per row

Row 8: Skip the first stitch, single crochet in each of the next stitches except the last one, double crochet in the last stitch, 1 chain stitch

Row 9: Skip the first stitch, single crochet in each of the next stitches

Row 10: Repeat Row 8

Row 11: Repeat Row 9

Row 12: Repeat Row 8

Row 13: Repeat Row 8

Row 14: Repeat Row 9

Row 15: Repeat Row 8

Row 16: Switch to brown yarn, repeat Row 9

Row 17: Repeat Row 9

Row 18: Repeat Row 8

Row 19: Repeat Row 9

Row 20: Repeat Row 8

Take the last stitch off the hook, cut the yarn, and pull the yarn through to create a slip knot

Repeat these steps to make the other side of the tail

Sew the two sides of the tail together, stuffing the tail each time you reach the bottom of one "line" of a zigzag.
