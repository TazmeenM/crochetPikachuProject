For the cheek circles:
Row 1: 6 single crochets in a magic ring
Row 2: 6 increasing stitches/an increasing stitch in each stitch (12 stitches total)
Row 3: A single crochet in each of the first two stitches
I sewed on the cheek circles around row 12 of the head, since that's where the "cheeks" were (since the head got wider at that point due to the increasing stitches), and I attached the eyes around row 10 of the head (right above the top of the cheek circles)

For the feet:
Row 1: 6 single stitches in a magic ring
Row 2: 6 increasing stitches/an increasing stitch in each stitch (12 stitches total)
Row 3: (3 single crochets, 3 increasing stitches) x 2 (18 stitches)
Row 4: (6 single crochets, 3 increasing stitches) x 2 (24 stitches)
Row 5: 54 single crochets (just over two rows of single crochets) (the reason why this number is so weird is because I thought I was working with 18 stitches per row when in reality I was working with 24 stitches per row, but the outcome was still okay so I just did the same thing with the other foot for symmetry)
